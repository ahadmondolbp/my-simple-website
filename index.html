    <p>Web development has a rich and fascinating history that spans several decades. The story of web development
      begins in
      the early 1990s with the invention of the World Wide Web by Sir Tim Berners-Lee. Developers would create static
      web
      pages using HTML and style them with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). In the late 1990s, JavaScript emerged as a
      scripting
      language that could be executed on the client side, enabling developers to create dynamic web pages.</p>
